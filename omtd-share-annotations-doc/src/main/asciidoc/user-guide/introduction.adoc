== Introduction

OpenMinTeD SHARE is a set of metadata elements to describe text and data-mining (TDM) and natural
language processing (NLP) resources.

== Package structure

We expect that the resource you distribute is packaged as a ZIP or JAR file. Within this file, 
you can place your OpenMinTeD descriptors at any location you like best. If you package descriptors
for TDM software components, you may wish to place them directly next to the classes that
implement the these components. If you package multiple resources, e.g. annotation schema
descriptions, in a single ZIP file you might wish to place the respective OpenMinTeD-SHARE
descriptions directly next to them.

However, in order to allow for the automatic detection of your OpenMinTeD-SHARE descriptors, you
will have to set up a file in a well-known location which points to your descriptors. This is
described in the next section.
