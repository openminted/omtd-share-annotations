=== Making descriptors discoverable

In order to make your descriptors discoverable, you have to create a folder called
`META-INF/eu.openminted.share` in your ZIP or JAR file. Into this folder, you have to place a file
called `descriptors.txt` with pointers to the actual descriptor files.

.Example `descriptors.txt` file

../../descriptors/Component1.xml

=== Discovering descriptors

We presently provide a convenience API for Java to discover descriptors. Additionally, we assume
for the moment, that any descriptors you may wish to discover exist on your Java classpath, i.e.
they are packaged as Maven artifacts.

NOTE: In the near future, we will also provide convenience methods to discover descriptors in
      explicitly named JAR and ZIP files that do not need to be on the Java classpath.
      
To locate the descriptors, you can use the `DescriptorFactory` class.
